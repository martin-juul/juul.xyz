I'm Martin, a software developer based in Denmark.\n\nI am a very curious about new technologies and enjoy trying out new flavors of development in my spare time.\n\nHolding myself to the highest standard, i take pride in delivering quality on time. As a self-starter, and not being afraid of taking ownership. I am rarely bored.\n\nWhether it is backend or frontend. I find both to be equally interesting. Presenting different challenges both cover many of the same paradigms. Implementation details aside."
