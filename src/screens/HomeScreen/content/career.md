Here I primarily work on a SIP Softphone application, which is written in react and wrapped in Electron.

Telephony is an overlooked industry, at least when you search GitHub for related projects, besides from the major players like Asterisk, FreeSwitch and Kamalio.

The upside of it is, that the tasks gets pretty interesting, as there are new problems you can't easily find an answer for, when scouring StackOverflow.

All of us developers partake in customer support over the phone. This is the first time I've done direct support, and I must say that, not only have I bettered my social skills. Most importantly we get direct feedback on how the software we make, has an impact on people.

## SiteTech
Jul 2018 - Mar 2020

Here I started out writing a node console app, that traded with digital currencies - based on traditional technical analysis, and a custom sentiment analyzer made for gauging interest on Twitter.

This project was what kickstarted my professional career, as we got a project from Jysk Fynske Medier (major news publisher in Denmark), to make a platform called [E-Profil](https://ugeavisen.dk/e-profil) for their advertisers to list themselves.

As the lead on the project, I wrote the backend and data importers in Laravel, while mentoring my colleague on the Vue.js frontend.

Architecting the infrastructure on AWS, using Terraform for IaaC.

Summarized the main components consist of: EC2, ECS, RDS Postgres, ElastiCache Redis, Cloudfront, Lambda, API Gateway. Autoscaling is configured with Cloudwatch alarms.

Due to the Corona pandemic and spending, SiteTech sadly went defunct in January 2020.

# Odense Kommune (Odense Municipality)
Oct 2017 - Feb 2018

Employed in their backend development department.

Here I was tasked with creating a web dashboard, for managing whitelisting and user requests for Windows AppLocker.

It was my first time creating an application with the .NET stack and introduced me to Angular.

On the side I did some Ad Hoc tasks, creating scripts for text replacement in OpenDoc/MS Word and bugfixing AutoHotKey scripts that are used by caseworkers for scraping internal systems.
