# Dozzle

[Dozzle website](https://dozzle.dev/)

If, like me, you run a little server with lots of small Docker containers, you’ve probably found yourself SSHing into the box to check container logs more often than you’d like.
Sure, tools like Kibana and other log management systems are great, but sometimes they feel like overkill.
When all you need is a quick way to view logs, without setting up a search backend or learning a new query language, there are simpler (and better-suited) options.

Let me present to you **Dozzle**.

It’s a neat piece of software that I stumbled upon, and it has been genuinely useful.

For my use case, I simply mapped Dozzle to my Docker host _/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro_
Now, I can click through all my containers and follow their logs in an okay web app.

## What Does It Do for Me?

Dozzle allows me to view multiple container logs in real-time, or at least near real-time. This is actually the main reason I use it, and it suits my needs perfectly.

It gets even better if you use Docker Compose. Dozzle will automatically detect and group your projects into the hosts pane, keeping things neat and organized. It’s a small detail, but one I appreciate since it makes keeping track of which logs belong to which containers much easier.

Another feature I’ve found handy is the ability to filter logs using SQL. This can come in clutch when you’re troubleshooting and want to narrow down results.

## Things I’d Like to See Improved

While Dozzle is already quite useful, there are a couple of features I’d love to see added in the future:

- **Stored Queries**: Being able to save commonly used queries would be great. For example, searching for error patterns in services like NGINX, Plex, or Laravel could become part of a handy workflow.

- **Tag-Based Filters**: Having the ability to apply stored filters on a per-container or tag basis would make troubleshooting even quicker.

## But for Now…

For now its more or less replaced `docker logs` with this tool on my home server (assuming this container stays up, of course). It just feels more convenient.
